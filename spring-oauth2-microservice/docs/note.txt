Token Introspection is done by this class.
org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.token.RemoteTokenServices

The class has a method that calls the URL https://localhost:9443/oauth2/introspect
and sends the client_id=admin and client_secret=admin to the Authorization Server (WSO2 Identity Server).

Note: It's awkward client_id & client_id nomenclature
